From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering%29) page:

> "A salon is a gathering of people under the roof of an inspiring host, held partly to amuse one another and partly to refine the taste and increase the knowledge of the participants through conversation. These gatherings often consciously followed Horace's definition of the aims of poetry, "either to please or to educate" ("aut delectare aut prodesse est")."

The Salon at St. Cecilia at the Tower will be hosted by Cynnabar's Baron and Baroness, Ermenrich and Kasha. It will be a performance opportunity for soloists and duos. In particular we are looking for performances where the performers have stretched themseleves in some way. Performers will give an introduction explaining why the piece is particularly challenging.

**How do I get to be one of the Performers in the Salon?**
