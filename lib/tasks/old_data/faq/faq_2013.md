**I want to teach!**  
It's over! Try again next year!  

**I play a modern instrument / sing in a non-Early Music choir. Can I participate?**  
Absolutely. If you can (more-or-less) read modern sheet music, you'll be able to fully participate in just about every class. We aren't picky about period instruments. Sure, renaissance recorders and shawms might be ideal, but plastic baroque recorders, oboes, modern flutes, french horns are all fine. We might draw the line at a [theremin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin). Maybe.  

**I can't carry a tune in a bucket, I don't read music, and I don't play any musical instruments. Will there be anything for me to do?**  
Yes, although a fair number of the classes will assume you have some musical knowledge. The lecture track won't require you to actually play or sing any music. You can sit in on the Master Class and watch the participants get their work critiqued. Also in the evening there will be a concert and you can listen to the other music making going on. Classes with little or no music background required will be marked.  

**What is this Master Class you speak of?**  
From the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_class) page:

> "The difference between a normal class and a master class is typically the setup. In a master class, all the students (and often spectators) watch and listen as the master takes one student at a time. The student (typically intermediate or advanced, depending on the status of the master) usually performs a single piece which they have prepared, and the master will give them advice on how to play it, often including anecdotes about the composer, demonstrations of how to play certain passages, and admonitions of common technical errors. The student is then usually expected to play the piece again, in light of the master's comments, and the student may be asked to play a passage repeatedly to attain perfection. Master classes for musical instruments tend to focus on the finer details of attack, tone, phrasing, and overall shape, and the student is expected to have complete control of more basic elements such as rhythm and pitch. The value of the master class setup is that all students can benefit from the master's comments on each piece."

In the Cecilia Day Master Class we'll have one or more Music Laurels play the part of the Master. 2 Performers or groups will play their prepared piece and the Master(s) will critique the performance.  

**How do I get to be one of the Performers in the Master Class?**  
It's Over! Try again next year!  

**What is the Concert about and how can I participate?**  

The concert will be performed by groups and individuals participating at St. Cecilia at the Tower. Groups can have up to a half hour of performance time, individuals can perform one song. Some historical and performance background on the pieces performed is requested. First priority will be for the Master Class participants, although they are not required to perform in the concert. Concert schedule is full! Email Jadzia next year. Early inquirers get longer performance slots.**I heard there will be unofficial musical gatherings throughout the weekend. Can you tell me more?** Saturday night after the evening activities have finished there will be a post revel at Jadzia and Aaron's House. Information on this will be given at the event.  

**Is this the last question?**  
No, there is one question after this one. There may be more questionswith answers as we update the website.  

**Why aren't there anymore questions?**  
Because everything you need to possibly know about this event is alreadyposted. If not, prove us wrong by asking us a question!
