**I want to teach!**
If you have a topic you're passionate about teaching, [let us know](mailto:ceciliaATcynnabarDOTorg). We will do our best to make sure that everyone who is interested in teaching gets to teach a class.

**I play a modern instrument / sing in a non-Early Music choir. Can I participate?**
Absolutely. If you can (more-or-less) read modern sheet music, you'll be able to fully participate in just about every class. We aren't picky about period instruments. Sure, renaissance recorders and shawms might be ideal, but plastic baroque recorders, oboes, modern flutes, french horns are all fine. We might draw the line at a [theremin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin). Maybe.

**I can't carry a tune in a bucket, I don't read music, and I don't play any musical instruments. Will there be anything for me to do?**
Yes, although a fair number of the classes will assume you have some musical knowledge. The lecture track won't require you to actually play or sing any music. You can attend the afternoon Salon and evening Concert. For the evening concert there will be program notes to help you better appreciate the music you are listening to. Classes with little or no music background required will be marked.

**What is this Salon you speak of?**
From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)) page:

> "A salon is a gathering of people under the roof of an inspiring host, held partly to amuse one another and partly to refine the taste and increase the knowledge of the participants through conversation. These gatherings often consciously followed Horace's definition of the aims of poetry, "either to please or to educate" ("aut delectare aut prodesse est")."

The Salon at St. Cecilia at the Tower will be hosted by Cynnabar's Baron and Baroness, Ermenrich and Kasha. It will be a performance opportunity for soloists and duos. In particular we are looking for performances where the performers have stretched themseleves in some way. Performers will give an introduction explaining why the piece is particularly challenging.

**How do I get to be one of the Performers in the Salon?**
Contact [The Event Stewards](mailto:ceciliaATcynnabarDOTorg).

**What are the Concerts about, and how can I participate?**
There will be a concert on Saturday evening. The performers will be groups and individuals participating at St. Cecilia at the Tower. Performance requirements:

*   Pieces must be composed before 1650 or in a pre-1650 style. See [the Concerts page](#concert) for more information.
*   Pieces must performed in an approximately period style. See [the Concerts page](#concert).

Participation in the concerts will be on a first come, first served basis. See the directions on [the Concerts page](#concert) if you or your group would like to be in the Concert.

**I heard there will be unofficial musical gatherings throughout the weekend. Can you tell me more?**
Saturday night after the evening activities have finished, there will be a post-revel. Information on this will be given at the event.

**Is this the last question?**
No, there is one question after this one. There may be more questions with answers as we update the website.

**Why aren't there any more questions?**
Because everything you need to possibly know about this event is already posted. If not, prove us wrong by [asking us a question](mailto:ceciliaATcynnabarDOTorg).
