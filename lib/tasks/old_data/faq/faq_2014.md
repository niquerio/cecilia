**I want to teach!**  
The class schedule has been finalized! See [Class Schedule](http://cynnabar.org/cecilia/schedule.php?kwds=3).  

**I play a modern instrument / sing in a non-Early Music choir. Can I participate?**  
Absolutely. If you can (more-or-less) read modern sheet music, you'll be able to fully participate in just about every class. We aren't picky about period instruments. Sure, renaissance recorders and shawms might be ideal, but plastic baroque recorders, oboes, modern flutes, french horns are all fine. We might draw the line at a [theremin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin). Maybe.  

**I can't carry a tune in a bucket, I don't read music, and I don't play any musical instruments. Will there be anything for me to do?**  
Yes, although a fair number of the classes will assume you have some musical knowledge. The lecture track won't require you to actually play or sing any music. You can sit in on the Master Class and watch the participants get their work critiqued. Also in the evenings there will be concerts, and you can listen to the other music making going on. Classes with little or no music background required will be marked.  

**What is this Master Class you speak of?**  
From the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_class) page:

> "The difference between a normal class and a master class is typically the setup. In a master class, all the students (and often spectators) watch and listen as the master takes one student at a time. The student (typically intermediate or advanced, depending on the status of the master) usually performs a single piece which they have prepared, and the master will give them advice on how to play it, often including anecdotes about the composer, demonstrations of how to play certain passages, and admonitions of common technical errors. The student is then usually expected to play the piece again, in light of the master's comments, and the student may be asked to play a passage repeatedly to attain perfection. Master classes for musical instruments tend to focus on the finer details of attack, tone, phrasing, and overall shape, and the student is expected to have complete control of more basic elements such as rhythm and pitch. The value of the master class setup is that all students can benefit from the master's comments on each piece."

This year's Cecilia Day Master Class will be led by [Christian d'Hiver](http://cynnabar.org/cecilia/profile.php?id=265), a Music Laurel from Calontir. Three groups will play their prepared pieces, and Master Christian will comment on their performances.  

**How do I get to be one of the Performers in the Master Class?**  
This year's master class schedule is full. Performers are Court and Country, the Roaring Wastrels, and the Pippins.  

**What are the Concerts about, and how can I participate?**  
There will be two concerts, one on Friday evening and one on Saturday evening. The performers will be groups and individuals participating at St. Cecilia at the Tower. Go to [the Concerts page](http://cynnabar.org/cecilia/concerts.php?kwds=3) to see who is performing.  

**I heard there will be unofficial musical gatherings throughout the weekend. Can you tell me more?**  
Saturday night after the evening activities have finished, there will be a post-revel. Information on this will be given at the event.  

**Is this the last question?**  
No, there is one question after this one. There may be more questions with answers as we update the website.  

**Why aren't there any more questions?**  
Because everything you need to possibly know about this event is already posted. If not, prove us wrong by [asking us a question](mailto:ceciliaATcynnabarDOTorg).
