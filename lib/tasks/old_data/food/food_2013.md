## Lunch Tavern

The meal will be that of a (slightly elevated) Elizabethan-era lunch in the fields. One could interpret it as a picnic for the upper-class, or a holiday feast for a ploughman.Every person will get:

*   Wheat bread (about 1/6th lb wedge)
*   Cheese (it will be a local cheddar, about 3oz)
*   1 apple
*   Pickled onions
*   1 wedge of yeasted cake (will contain currants, ale, butter, eggs--more like a fruited brioche than a modern cake)

**Price**: $5**Lunch Tavern Steward**: Mistress Tacit Darby
