After the concert there will be a couple of participatory activities. Instrumetal Sight-Reading and Singing  

## Instrumental Sight Reading

Master Christian will be leading this. Bring your soft instruments of all sizes. Christian will provide sheet music and conducting. :)  

## Singing

Lady Jadzia will lead a bit of an experiment. It's a combination of **sight-singing popular madrigals** and **period solo singing**. If there's a particular **part-song** you'd like us all to sing, do the following

*   Let [Jadzia](profile.php?id=2) know before the event (so she can find copies) OR
*   Bring a copy of the part-song you'd like to sing to the event. To get your song added to the list:
    *   Add it to the part-song list that will be available at gate.
    *   Leave your copy of the piece at gate so we can make copies for the evening and/or
    *   Leave your stack of copies (at least 10) so we can use them.
