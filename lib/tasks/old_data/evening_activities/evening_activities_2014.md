## Period Sing Along

Have a piece of solo music you've been itching to sing, but haven't had an opportunity to share it? At the Sing Along we'll go around in a circle and present everyone an opportunity to share a piece or two. Songs with audience participation encouraged. (Ex: Choruses, Drones, Clapping, etc. )
