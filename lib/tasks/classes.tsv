2014-05-09 00:00:00 -0400	gyuri	The Quest for a New Musical Expression	"Full title - The Quest for a New Musical Expression: The Transformation of Musical Style from the Renaissance to the Early Baroque. Some composers are born at times when a given artistic style is well-established, speaking the preponderant musical language as naturally as they breathe. At other times, when previously dominant forms of expression are falling out of favor, aspiring young composers must struggle to shape their musical ideas into new and hitherto unexplored forms. This creates a diversity of ""experimental"" styles, until things settle down again, with the rise of a new dominant style. Here we will be looking at the transition that happened at the end of the 17th century, and the various approaches which eventually led to what we now call the Baroque. With plenty of musical examples, by composers ranging from Giovanni Gabrieli to Heinrich Schutz.
